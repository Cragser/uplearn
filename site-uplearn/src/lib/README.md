# Lib Directory

This directory is designated for components that are intended to be extracted into their own standalone libraries in the future. These components should be designed with reusability and portability in mind.

## Purpose

- Store components that have potential for broader use across different projects
- Maintain components that could be published as separate NPM packages
- Facilitate code sharing and standardization across the organization

## Current Status

This directory is currently not in active use in the project, but remains available for future library candidates.
