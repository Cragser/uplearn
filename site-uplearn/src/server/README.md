# Server Layer Documentation

## Architecture Overview
The server layer follows a hexagonal architecture pattern, providing a clear separation of concerns and maintainable codebase structure.

## Directory Structure

### /adapter
Adapters are services that abstract external libraries for specific execution requirements. They provide a clean interface between our application and third-party dependencies like Moodle, AnkiConnect, and Azure AI.

Example adapters:
- MoodleAdapter: Handles Moodle LMS integration
- AnkiConnectAdapter: Manages communication with Anki flashcard system
- AzureAIAdapter: Interfaces with Azure AI services

### /api
API modules contain all external API integrations and their corresponding implementations. These modules handle:
- REST endpoints definitions
- Request/Response handling
- API versioning
- Authentication/Authorization middleware

### /error
Error handling modules provide a centralized approach to error management, including:
- Custom error classes
- Error logging and monitoring
- Error response formatting
- Global error middleware

### /mock
Mock data modules contain test data and mock implementations used for:
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Development environment
- API documentation examples

### /types
Type definitions specific to the server implementation, including:
- Domain models
- DTO (Data Transfer Objects)
- API request/response types
- Configuration interfaces

### /wrappers
Wrapper services abstract complex behaviors and provide simplified interfaces for:
- Database operations
- Caching mechanisms
- Authentication flows
- External service integrations

## Best Practices
- Follow SOLID principles
- Implement proper error handling
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document API endpoints
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Maintain consistent coding style
