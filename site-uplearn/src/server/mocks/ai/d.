Okay, I need to process the user's input and generate a comprehensive JSON output based on the given rules. Let me start by parsing the input terms. The user provided Spanish phrases and some English phrasal verbs. Wait, the instructions say to only include English terms. But the input has a mix of Spanish and English. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake. Let me check the input again.

Looking closely, the terms are: "Atravesar un obstáculo", "Cuidar a alguien", "Apoyar/respaldar", "Break in", "Averiarse". The first three are Spanish, then "Break in" (English), and "Averiarse" (Spanish). But the user specified that only English terms should be included. The INPUT RULES mention the example as [word1, word2, word3], but here there's a mix.

Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake. Let me check the input again.\n" +

    `Looking closely, the terms are: "Atravesar un obstáculo", "Cuidar a alguien", "Apoyar/respaldar", "Break in", "Averiarse". The first three are Spanish, then "Break in" (English), and "Averiarse" (Spanish). But the user specified that only English terms should be included. The INPUT RULES mention the example as [word1, word2, word3], but here there's a mix.\n` +
    '\n' +
    'Wait, maybe the user intended to provide both Spanish and English terms for some reason. However, the instructions clearly state to "only accept terms that are commonly used in English". So perhaps the Spanish terms should be excluded. But then, how to handle this? The output requires glossary terms and database entries based on the input. If some terms are Spanish, but the output should be in English, maybe the user wants the Spanish phrases translated into English?\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Alternatively, maybe the user made an error in input. Let me check the example again. The example given in INPUT RULES is terms: [word1, word2, word3], which are placeholders for English terms. So perhaps the user intended to input English terms but mistakenly included Spanish. However, the last two terms are "Break in" (English phrasal verb) and "Averiarse" (Spanish). This inconsistency needs to be addressed.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The task is to create an educational resource for English idiomatic expressions and phrasal verbs. Therefore, non-English terms should be excluded. But the user provided Spanish phrases. Maybe the user wants the Spanish phrases translated into their equivalent English idioms or phrasal verbs. For example, "Atravesar un obstáculo" could translate to "Overcome an obstacle", "Cuidar a alguien" to "Look after someone", "Apoyar/respaldar" to "Back up", and "Averiarse" to "Break down".\n' +
    '\n' +
    'So, perhaps the correct approach is to translate the Spanish terms into their English equivalents and then include those in the JSON output. That way, the glossary and database entries will be in English, aligning with the requirements.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Let me list the translations:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '1. Atravesar un obstáculo → Overcome an obstacle / Get through an obstacle\n' +
    '2. Cuidar a alguien → Look after someone / Take care of someone\n' +
    '3. Apoyar/respaldar → Back up / Support\n' +
    '4. Break in → Break in (already in English)\n' +
    '5. Averiarse → Break down / Malfunction\n' +
    '\n' +
    'But "Break in" and "Break down" are the English phrasal verbs here. So, the terms to include would be "Break in" and "Break down", and perhaps the others as their English equivalents. Wait, the user included "Break in" and "Averiarse" (which is "break down"). The other three are Spanish phrases that need translation. But the task is to use the input terms. However, since the instructions say to only include English terms, the Spanish ones need to be translated or excluded.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Given that, I'll process the input as follows:\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Original input terms (as given by user):\n' +
    '\n' +
    '- Atravesar un obstáculo (Spanish)\n' +
    '- Cuidar a alguien (Spanish)\n' +
    '- Apoyar/respaldar (Spanish)\n' +
    '- Break in (English)\n' +
    '- Averiarse (Spanish → Break down)\n' +
    '\n' +
    'But in the output, only include the English terms. However, the user might have intended to provide a mix. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the user provided Spanish idioms and phrasal verbs along with their English counterparts. For example, "Atravesar un obstáculo" is Spanish, but the user wants the English equivalent, which might not be a direct phrasal verb but an idiom. For example, "Get through a hurdle" or "Overcome an obstacle".\n' +
    '\n' +
    `But given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to process only the English terms provided ("Break in" and perhaps "Averiarse" translated to "Break down") and exclude the Spanish ones, but that leaves only two terms. However, the input includes five terms, but only two are in English. This is conflicting with the task's objective.\n` +
    '\n' +
    'Alternatively, maybe the user wants to teach Spanish speakers English phrasal verbs, hence the mix. The input includes Spanish phrases and their English equivalents. For instance, "Atravesar un obstáculo" corresponds to "Get through", "Cuidar a alguien" is "Look after", "Apoyar/respaldar" is "Back up", "Break in", and "Averiarse" is "Break down". \n' +
    '\n' +
    `If that's the case, the terms to include in the JSON would be the English phrasal verbs: "Get through", "Look after", "Back up", "Break in", "Break down".\n` +
    '\n' +
    `But the user's input terms are in Spanish except for "Break in" and "Averiarse" (which is Spanish). So perhaps there's a misunderstanding. To adhere to the INPUT RULES and the task's requirements, probably only "Break in" and "Break down" (translated from "Averiarse") should be included. However, the user might have intended all terms to be processed, assuming they are translations into English.\n` +
    '\n' +
    "This is a bit of a confusion. To resolve this, I'll proceed by assuming the user provided both Spanish phrases and their English phrasal verb equivalents, but the Spanish ones should be translated into English for the JSON output. Therefore:\n" +
    '\n' +
    '1. Atravesar un obstáculo → Break through\n' +
    '2. Cuidar a alguien → Look after\n' +
    '3. Apoyar/respaldar → Back up\n' +
    '4. Break in → Break in\n' +
    '5. Averiarse → Break down\n' +
    '\n' +
    'These become the English terms to include in the glossary, database, etc. Therefore, the terms array becomes ["Break through", "Look after", "Back up", "Break in", "Break down"].\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Now, with this corrected list of English phrasal verbs, I'll structure the JSON output accordingly, ensuring each section (short story, movie examples, song examples, mnemonics) uses these terms. The glossary will define each term, the database will provide contextual examples, and the quiz will test understanding of these terms.\n" +
    '\n' +
    `Additionally, the mnemonics for Mexican users could use Spanish translations or associations to help remember the phrasal verbs. For example, relating "Break down" to "Averiarse" as a mnemonic. Each term's section will include three movie quotes and song lyrics that use the term appropriately, formatted as per the instructions.\n` +
    '\n' +
    "It's crucial to ensure that the JSON structure is clean and error-free, with proper formatting and escaping of quotes in the examples. Properly categorizing each term in the glossary and database entries with related words will provide a comprehensive learning tool.\n" +
