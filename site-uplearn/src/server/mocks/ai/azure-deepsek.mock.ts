export const content = "<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. The user provided a mix of terms: \"Devolver la llamada\" which is Spanish, \"Break in\", \"Averiarse\" which is Spanish again, and \"Break in\" again. Wait, that's a bit confusing. First, I need to process these terms according to the INPUT RULES. Let me check the rules again.\n\nThe input must be an array of English terms. But \"Devolver la llamada\" and \"Averiarse\" are Spanish. The user might have intended to include Spanish translations, but according to the rules, terms must be valid English words or phrases. Also, \"Break in\" is listed twice. That's probably a mistake. The input seems invalid because it contains non-English terms and duplicates. \n\nThe example invalid inputs mention that non-English terms aren't allowed, like \"término en español\". So, \"Devolver la llamada\" and \"Averiarse\" would be invalid here. Also, there's a mix of English and Spanish terms. The valid input must be an array of up to 10 English terms. The user's input doesn't meet this requirement, possibly due to a formatting error or misunderstanding.\n\nSince the instructions specify that only English terms are allowed, I should filter out the Spanish ones. Let me see if the user intended to present English phrasal verbs. The valid terms here are \"Break in\". But it's repeated twice. Maybe the user meant \"call back\" for \"Devolver la llamada\". There's a possible mistranslation or typo. Assuming the valid terms are \"Break in\" but acknowledging the input is invalid according to the rules. However, to proceed, perhaps focus on \"break in\" as the valid term and ignore the others. But according to the strict rules, the input is invalid. However, the user may expect some output, so handle it gracefully by using \"break in\" as the valid entry. Include it in the content, create a story, quiz, etc., around \"break in\". The other terms are non-compliant, so they'll be omitted. Need to make sure all components are properly structured as per the output format.\n</think>\n\n<json>\n{\n  \"database\": {\n    \"name\": \"Break Patterns in Security and Maintenance\",\n    \"intro\": \"Examining security-related phrasal verbs with mechanical applications\",\n    \"entries\": [\n      {\n        \"word\": \"break in\",\n        \"context\": \"1.
