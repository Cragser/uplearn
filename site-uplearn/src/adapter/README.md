# Adapter Layer

This directory contains services and libraries that are subject to change, requiring abstractions to maintain flexibility and modularity.

## Purpose

- Houses adaptable services and libraries
- Provides abstractions for external dependencies
- Manages markdown processing functionality
- Facilitates easy replacement of underlying implementations

## Guidelines

1. Create abstractions (interfaces) for all external services
2. Implement adapters for specific libraries or services
3. Keep implementation details isolated from the rest of the application
4. Document dependencies and their versions

## Structure

- `/markdown` - Markdown processing implementation
- `/interfaces` - Abstract interfaces for services
- `/implementations` - Concrete implementations of interfaces
- `/utils` - Helper functions for adapters
