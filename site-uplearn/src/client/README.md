# Client Layer Documentation

This directory contains the client-side implementation of the application, organized according to our hexagonal architecture principles.

## Directory Structure

### API
Contains API integration adapters and interfaces for communicating with external services. This layer handles all HTTP requests and response transformations.

### Components
Reusable UI components specific to this project. Each component is self-contained and follows the single responsibility principle, avoiding direct dependencies on other components.

### Modules
Feature-specific modules that require API integration. These modules implement the business logic for specific features and coordinate between the UI components and API layer.

### Store
State management implementation for the application. Handles global state, caching, and state updates across components and modules.

### Styles
Application-wide styling definitions, including theme configurations, global styles, and shared style utilities.
